-- ðŸŽ¯ Turn Things Off

-- Turn off any running tasks and pause your pipe with:
-- alter pipe mypipe set pipe_execution_paused = true;
-- We won't use these tasks or pipes anymore in this course.
ALTER TASK ags_game_audience.raw.cdc_load_logs_enhanced SUSPEND;

show pipes;

alter pipe PIPE_GET_NEW_FILES set pipe_execution_paused = true;
-- ðŸ““ Create a CURATED Layer

-- Once data is enhanced, a Data Engineer might move it to a Curated state.
-- This involves additional processing for better analysis and efficiency.

-- In this lesson, we'll create dashboard charts to check data quality and
-- use a windowing function to summarize data into a more meaningful set.

-- ðŸŽ¯ Create a CURATED Layer

-- Create a SCHEMA named CURATED in the AGS_GAME_AUDIENCE database.
-- Ensure the schema is owned by SYSADMIN.

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS ags_game_audience.curated;

/*ðŸ““ Snowflake Dashboards

Snowflake dashboards can display charts and tables together.
They're not as advanced as Tableau or Looker but offer basic data analysis.
Though still new, Snowflake plans to improve dashboards in future releases.

Kishore's goal was to load the data for Agnie to analyze.
Before handing it off, he wants to create simple visualizations for basic insights. */

/*ðŸ““ What Matters Most?

Kishore reviews the ENHANCED_LOGS charts and considers what Agnie might value.
He notices duplicate events for each gamer and thinks the "game_session_length"
could be more valuable than individual login and logout data.

He wants to analyze if the time of day correlates with session length.
Although Agnie didn't request it, Kishore spends 30 minutes exploring this. */
