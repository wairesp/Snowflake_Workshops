/*
üìì Allowing Our Task to Run Itself
Step 1: Files load into the external stage every 5 minutes, fully
automated with no compute costs, managed by Snowflake Education.

Step 2: A task set to run every 5 minutes is not yet automated. Using
the EXECUTE TASK command can quickly use up trial credits, especially
with a high-frequency task.

Ensure safeguards before scheduling tasks. Set up a Resource Monitor
to control pipeline costs.

üìì Forgotten Tasks Can Eat Up Credits, Fast!
A task set to run every 5 minutes, once activated, will use trial
credits. To prevent this, set up a RESOURCE MONITOR with a daily limit
of 1 credit hour. This will shut down tasks daily, avoiding credit waste.

üéØ Create a Resource Monitor to Limit Usage
We‚Äôll create a daily Resource Monitor with a 1 credit hour limit. It
can be adjusted as needed to prevent runaway costs.
*/

ENHANCED.LOGS_ENHANCED to remove old rows. Starting with zero rows
makes it easier to verify that the new processes work as expected.

Our process is looking good. We have:

Step 1 TASK (invisible to you, but running every 5 minutes)
Step 2 TASK that will load the new files into the raw table every 5 minutes (as soon as we turn it on).
Step 3 VIEW that is kind of boring but it does some light transformation (JSON-parsing) work for us.  
Step 4 TASK  that will load the new rows into the enhanced table every 5 minutes (as soon as we turn it on).


So let's turn on the TASKS!! 

ü•ã Turn on Your Tasks!
You can suspend and resume tasks using the GUI. 

You can also resume and suspend them using worksheet code.

/*

‚ùï You Have Tasks Running!
You have tasks currently running and a Resource Monitor set to stop
everything after one hour.

Always shut off tasks when you finish for the day to save credits. The
Resource Monitor helps protect your free credits but turning off tasks
manually is more efficient.

If the Resource Monitor shuts everything down due to exceeding your
daily quota, adjust the quota to 2 or 3 credits in the monitor settings
to continue working. The monitor is there to protect you but can be
edited as needed.

Refresh the page after it runs again and check if it succeeded.
NOTE: If the task isn‚Äôt owned by SYSADMIN, SUSPEND it, change the
ownership, and then RESUME it. If it‚Äôs not running, use the ALTER command
ending in RESUME.

üéØ Check on the GET_NEW_FILES Task
Use the same methods to check your other scheduled task. Ensure it‚Äôs
running and succeeding!

/*üèÜ Keeping Tallies in Mind
Check Files: Count the files in the stage and multiply by 10. This
is your expected row count.

Check PL_GAME_LOGS: Verify the number of rows in PL_GAME_LOGS,
which is populated by the GET_NEW_FILES task.

Check PL_LOGS: The PL_LOGS view normalizes PL_GAME_LOGS without
altering the row count. Ensure PL_LOGS has the same number of rows.

Check LOGS_ENHANCED: Confirm the number of rows in LOGS_ENHANCED,
which is enhanced using PL_LOGS and other tables. No rows should be lost.

NOTE: Row loss in Step 4 may occur due to failed time zone lookups
against IPINFO_GEOLOC. This is acceptable at this project phase. */

select count(*) from AGS_GAME_AUDIENCE.RAW.PL_LOGS;

--Step 4 - number of rows in enhanced table (should be file count x 10 but fewer rows is okay because not all IP addresses are available from the IPInfo share)
select count(*) from AGS_GAME_AUDIENCE.ENHANCED.LOGS_ENHANCED;

/*
üìì A Few Task Improvements
Timing Issues: Timing discrepancies might affect row counts. For example,
a file might be added but not picked up by GET_NEW_FILES, or rows might
be processed by GET_NEW_FILES but not by LOAD_LOGS_ENHANCED.

TASK DEPENDENCIES:
To address this, set up task dependencies. You can‚Äôt control the Step 1 task,
but you can manage the Step 2 (GET_NEW_FILES) and Step 4 (LOAD_LOGS_ENHANCED)
tasks. Consider running GET_NEW_FILES every 5 minutes and triggering
LOAD_LOGS_ENHANCED only after GET_NEW_FILES finishes, reducing uncertainty.

SERVERLESS COMPUTE:
Currently, your warehouse spins up for each task run and may not auto-suspend
in time, leading to high costs. Instead, use Snowflake‚Äôs "SERVERLESS" option,
which leverages existing compute resources and is more cost-effective for small,
frequent tasks. Grant the SERVERLESS privilege to SYSADMIN to use this mode.
